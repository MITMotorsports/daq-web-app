# DAQ Web App

We use [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) to build this frontend.

To install dependencies, run `npm install`

To start the dev environment, run `npm start`

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used to format code. Files should get automatically formatted on commit. If you'd like to automatically format your code as you work, make sure your editor can find the `.prettierrc.json` file.
